McKenzie beach is close by, and the food restaurants off the opposite beach were only a ten minute walk.
Air con and fridge in rooms with a bottle of water provided. 
Perfect for our short stay and the hotel was immaculately clean. I was particularly impressed when the staff emailed me via booking.com and after asking me what time I was arriving (the hotel is not manned 24/7 but arrangements are made to collect your room key in the hotel if you are arriving outside of normal hours), told me which bus routes I needed to take.

Very helpful and pleasant people who speak perfect English and couldn't have been better -- all the way from the booking process and online dialog to putting us on a taxi to the airport! This alone is reason enough to come back :-)
Rooms and hotel in general are very clean, aircon modern and quiet, and room service is also excellent.
Plenty of electricity outlets in the room, also by the bed, but remember the UK-adapter to use standard EU-plugs ;-)
The double bed, although nothing fancy, was probably the best hotel bed we've slept in ... ever!!!","Except excellent staff/owners and an ok restaurant, there is not much extra in this hotel or in the room. 
Tips for improvement:
- The out-of-order pool table hidden away in the backyard should be brought back to life.
- The backyard itself could actually have been used so much better. 
- The small fridge in the room was warm (turned off) upon arrival and completely empty, and no local shop/kiosk nearby to fill it up. One small bottle of water upon arrival to double room feels a little poor. Would gladly have paid those 2‚Ç¨ more per day to have 2 bottles initially and being refilled daily with room service. A couple of cents more, to have even tea on the small welcome tray ;-)
- Bathroom floor gets completely wet when (carefully) showering, as only half a glass wall covers the shower. 
- Bed frame has very sharp/hard corners, and it's easy to get hurt. Apply baby safety corners?
- Veranda door and main door doesn't close entirely tight so main door slams in the night when it's windy. However fixable in MacGyver way using the bed cover and a tea spoon, although a professional seal attached to the door frame would probably be a better fix long-term ;-)
- Beach towel services would also have been nice and useful, to avoid using lots of space/weight in baggage.
All in all, this hotel is great but still has room for improvement in many little details which could easily be fixed. Still getting our high rating as the staff is simply the best and made our stay a true pleasure, thus above comments should not scare anyone from booking this hotel. We highly recommend it and would definitely love to return!",9.0,Travelling,Sweden,Double Room with Balcony,3 nights,May 2022,Couple,"thank you for your comments and for all these details. we will take into consideration every single detail you wrote.

Best hotel in Cyprus,"If I could give more than a rating of 10 I would. 
The location is amazing. Being close to the airport in Larnaka makes travelling easier. Also being right next to the Salt Lake is a must-see especially if there is a good sunset. 
Within a 10 minute walk you can be on MacKenzie beach which is well maintained and cleaner than other beaches we seen in Larnaka. Rebuke lounge at the beach is worth visiting for the quality of food and decor. 
The hotel is next to a bus stop for travelling between downtown and other locations. Very handy since we didn‚Äôt hire a car. 
The staff make this hotel great. They are friendly, warm, helpful. Always willing to do more to make the guest have a better stay. 
The recently renovated room is about as clean as it could be. The facilities are modern and new. The shower is amazing for couples to use together. The balcony is a nice addition to an already fresh, well presented room. 
The double bed is extremely comfortable and the new bedding was a delight. It is hard to get a comfortable sheet to sleep with in a country as warm as Cyprus but we were happy with everything offered by the hotel. 
The minibar was extremely reasonably priced and well stocked. 
Aircon perfect, easy to use. 
Wifi great when we used it. 
We didn‚Äôt take advantage of the pool in the hotel only because we ran out of time but on another trip we would have done so. 
The front of the hotel is an extremely nice place to unwind in the evening.",Minor point: a bar for hanging clothes in the room was the only thing we felt was missing to improve our stay.,10.0,James,United Kingdom,Double Room with Balcony,3 nights,July 2021,Couple,"thank you,  thank you soo much, we really appreciated your comments and the detailed description; you are amazing, we are glad you enjoyed your stay with us, we were so happy  having you as our guests; hope to see you another time. and again, thanks for every detail you wrote about us and the hotel."

- the shower of our room is very inconviniently placed, making a mess because of insufficient coverage of the bathroom glass
- the edges of the shower (between wall tiles and the shower floor) need replacement - they are hollow and seem moldy
- the bin is rusty
- the mirror is weirdly placed, on the right of the sink
- due to the placement of the curtains, a lot of light gets in the room in the morning
- there is no designated parking, you just park wherever you find
- we have requested late check out (1pm) which we got and we appreciate it. However, we got a call that prompted us to check out at the normal time (12pm) as the next customers would arrive.

No simple sheets on the bed either...
Our only other choice was to close the a/c an go without covers but we could not open the windows because it was very very noisy. 
Also the windows had no soundproofing whatsoever because the noise was too much!!
We gave the duvet a chance up to 3 am and then got up and opened the windows when the noise went down. We had to leave to catch a flight at 5am... Not a good night's sleep!!!

I feel bad writing a negative review because they were kind; however, only things near the garbage should be thrown out.  Not stuff next to guests' belongings.

I do not recommend! Very low price-quality ratio!","Breakfast ok.
Clean room, comfortable bed.","With the exception of one gentleman at the reception, no other employee was wearing a mask.
The small room, with almost non-existent storage spaces, an extremely small balcony.
Thin walls, all night I heard how other travelers checked in.
At 3 o'clock in the morning, the garbage was picked up from the street, in an infernal mess....
At 7 o'clock in the morning I tried to open the door to the balcony and I was very close to throwing up instantly. It seems that there are some farms nearby... it smelled like concentrated manure....
The adapter found in the room burned/melted 2 phone chargers.",3.0,Sorena,Romania,Double Room with Balcony,1 night,October 2021,Couple,

friendly stay",Excellent attention. Very comfortable bed. Very good shower. The furniture and bathroom are all new and impeccable. Very good WiFi connection. Bars and restaurants nearby.,"In the photo of the room on Booking, you can't see a column that takes up space and is uncomfortable. The balcony on the first floor is very low, not very intimate, close to the street and the hotel lobby, you can even smell the smoke from the cigarettes that smoke there. The safe does not make sense since it is not walled, it does not matter if you leave the money in a bag. They could put shampoo in the bathroom, not just soap.

Hotel for one night","A hotel for those who make a long transfer in Cyprus. That is ""hotel for one night"".
Pros:
1. cleanliness
2. the beach is within walking distance.
3. a couple of taverns in the area
4. near the airport","We lived for a week
1. Bed linen was never changed (cleaning and change of towels daily);
2. the number is microscopic. Rented Nissan Micra and then more;
3. the refrigerator is full of minibar for money, I had to pull everything out so that my products would fit;
4. the hotel did not allow to turn over a couple of hours before the delayed plane;
5. walk to the promenade of Larnaca for about 20 minutes, to Lidl for an hour and a half.
The hotel is really for one night.",6.0,Aleksandr,Russia,Double Room with Balcony,7 nights,September 2021,Group,"thank you for your comments. normally we changed the bed linen every 4 to 5 days, ,aybe there was a mistake in the program of changing the bed linen in your room.
as for the minibar, yes there are items at competitive prices in order to provide our guests facilities; you could ask us to remove our items and you put your things.
we thank you for your recommendation hotel for one night, but we assure you that we had a lot of long stays guests for more than 2 weeks who were satisfied , comfortable and happy.
